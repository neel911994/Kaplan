Two world wars were won and lost on its battle fields, and the great ideological struggles of the Cold War were played out in its cities. The Atlantic Ocean was the locus of international power. This is no longer the case, as bestselling author Robert D. Kaplan deftly proves in Monsoon. He shows how the rise of India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Burma and Oman, among others, represents a crucial shift in the global balance of power. It is in 'Monsoon Asia' that the fight for democracy, energy independence and religious freedom will be lost or won. It is here that European interests are being replaced by Chinese and Indian influences, and where the often tense dialogue is taking place between Islam and the West. It is towards this region that global powers need to shift their focus if they are to remain dominant in the new century.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781459605428"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"145960542X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":652,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":6,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=kaplan+test+prep&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC&dq=kaplan+test+prep&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Monsoon.html?hl=&id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"IN","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"IN","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Atlantic Ocean was the locus of international power.
